# Stock market Price Prediction Project

This was my semester 3 Python project where I had to clean the data in Excel and stored it in MySQL as a 'daily price' table. 
I queried data using Python and extracted relevant features into a data frame. 
Employed feature engineering techniques, including technical indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD). 
Utilized Linear regression for stock price prediction and Random Forest Classifier for generating buy/sell signals. 
These models were chosen for their ability to handle large datasets and provide accurate results. 
I evaluated the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy.
I've provided CSV files with the cleaned data so you can easily upload them into your own MySQL database and run the code. 
Make sure to change the 'host', 'user', 'password' and 'database' values in databse connector
